This project is inspired from Adminium and pgweb. These projects are cross platform postgres editors. The features are:

1. Cross-platform.
2. Click cell to edit. Enter to save.

But Adminium does not open as a public service but only be an add-on of heroku. pgweb is lack of saving data by press enter. Both of them do not provide user management.
